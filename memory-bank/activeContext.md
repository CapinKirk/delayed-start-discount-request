- **Status**: Optimized with caching and batch operations
- **Mitigation**: Efficient data handling implemented

## Open Questions

1. **User Access**: What level of access does the user have to the required spreadsheets? âœ… DOCUMENTED
2. **Slack Setup**: Does the user have admin access to create Slack apps? âœ… DOCUMENTED
3. **Testing Environment**: Should we create test spreadsheets for development? âœ… READY FOR TESTING
4. **Deployment**: What is the target deployment environment and access level? âœ… DOCUMENTED
